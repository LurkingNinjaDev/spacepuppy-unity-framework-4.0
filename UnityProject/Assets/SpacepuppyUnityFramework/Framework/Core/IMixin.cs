    /// Since C# doesn't support multiple inheritance, we instead implement a mixin as an interface. 
    /// All mixin's should inherit from IMixin for initialization purpose. The interface is then attributed 
    /// with a MixinConstructorAttribute which acts as the signal for when a object with a mixin is 
    /// initialized/constructed. 
    /// 
    /// This constructor attribute can then do what it needs to to implement the the mixin. 
    /// 
    /// For mixin that just performs an action, it can register that action right then and there (such 
    /// as registering for events). 
    /// 
    /// For a mixin that needs state, you can create a state object there and store it somewhere (usually 
    /// as a component on the GameObject of the mixin). 
    /// 
    /// If you want the mixin to have methods, you should create a static class with extension methods 
    /// that accept the mixin interface as the first parameter.
    ///

    /// you must call MixinUtil.Initialize during the constructor/awake of the class.
